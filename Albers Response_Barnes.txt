This article confirms my suspicion that there is a split between those who actually write and those that manage that writing. I particularly liked the analogy to coders. A project that is expected to be cohesive cannot be developed without an overarching vision to inform the structure of the document as well as how it should be written. It’s easy to conflate the single sourcing work that we did in our project as how it will go in the real world, but in reality the projects that are worked on in the field are far too massive in scope to be handled by a single person. 
One thing this made me wonder is at what point are we over dividing work? Obviously I don’t have any field experience to answer this question, but I feel like if we take these principle to their logical extreme the quality of the overall document might suffer in response to the work being over divided.
This article also made me hope that at some point one of our projects can prepare us for the structure of such a team. Maybe a project with team leaders for each part that all design a document or better yet writing something with an entire class. I think such experience would be beneficial to prepare students both to manage information but also to write as part of a team.
The article made me appreciate the class more, but also made me weary to the fact that the real world will be much more complicated than our simple projects. I’m hoping that the skills I develop here can put me in the position of management when I head out to the field.
