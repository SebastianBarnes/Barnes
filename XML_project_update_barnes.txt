Progress had been going well up until recently, but I have hit a few major roadblocks. I have gotten my XSLT to transform my data into a graph but I haven't figured out how to get the nested data that's deeper into the XML. That said, I believe with a bit of help that will be an easy fix. 
The more pressing issue is that I've come to realize there is much less data on my topic than I had realized. The site I'm collecting the data from only lists win/loss ratio vs the big 6 on the top six players. This wouldn't be too much of an issue but there is no central hub to search results of past smash tournaments that I have found. I also realized that most players would have zero wins or zero games played vs the top six so that data may be less interesting than I initially thought. I'm going to try my best to make the structure I've developed work, but I feel I have a good enough working knowledge of XML and XSLT that I wouldn't mind switching topics at this point if that was still an option.
Looking forward my next concern if I can find this data is finding a way for Java to do the math to determine which win loss ratios are best to work for my sorting algorithm.
