		<h1>Uses for XSLT</h1>
		<p>XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation) is a transformation language that allows you to change XML documents into other formats or differently formatted XML file. XSLTâ€™s most common use if for transforming XML in HTML. XSLT essentially allows you to search for specific tabs and either alter their contents or place other content in relation to it.</p>
		<p>XSLT can be useful to Technical Communicators in a number of ways. The most useful tool XSLT offers to Technical Communicators is printing data into HTML. This is the most immediate implication to XSLT but the ability to reformate XML quickly is invaluable. For example, if you were to transfer data from one company to another each company may have different XML standards. Without XSLT this process would take a huge amount of work time just to process but with XSLT it is a simple matter of coding.</p>
		<p>XSLT is also at the base of systems that allow XML to be transformed into PDF which has the benefit of being more difficult to alter than other file types. With enough work between XML can be transformed into any data type and XSLT is at the base of most of those transformations.</p>
		<p>Ultimately we can draw analogies between XSLT and CSS. Both allow for the transformation of large files incredibly quickly and enable both HTML and XML to be used in the way we understand them today.</p>
